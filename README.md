# Interacting with Sushiswap smart contracts via block explorer :sushi:
Instructions for simple interactions with Sushiswap smart contracts, through Etherscan-style block explorers.
As well as some common issues and how to resolve them.

**Please note**: This is designed for one with some familiarity, to guide others who may have little to none.<br>
It is possible for example to burn any value of lp token when unstaking, if inputting the zero address under the _to_ field, instead of one's own wallet address.
As such, newer users should be guided, rather than directly linked.

_Again_ what may seem obvious to you, might not be to someone who guesses that is the way to unstake and remove liquidity within a single transaction. <br>
So best to guide and highlight those values.

!!!! PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT ALL VALUES (AMOUNTS, ADDRESSES, ETC..) ARE JUST FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE SMART CONTRACTS USERS SHOULD USE THEIR OWN WALLET ADDRESSES, CORRESPONDING CONTRACT ADDRESSES AND AMOUNT VALUES !!!!
